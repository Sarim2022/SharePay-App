🚀 SharePay – Expense & Wallet Management App

SharePay is a full-stack mobile application built using Jetpack Compose (Android) and Spring Boot (Backend).
It allows users to sign up, log in, and manage their wallet, expenses, lending, and borrowing records.

This project is built as part of my learning journey in Android development and backend API design. <br>
